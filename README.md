# jollibee-test-ios-app
This is a test application for Jollibee, built using Kotlin and Jetpack Compose. The app demonstrates user registration and authentication by integrating with a Laravel API.

## Features
User Registration: Allows new users to create an account by providing their name, email, and password.

API Integration: Uses Retrofit to handle network calls to the Laravel backend for user registration and authentication.

Input Validation: Includes client-side validation for empty fields and password length to ensure data integrity before making an API request.

## Technologies Used
Swift: The primary programming language for iOS development.

SwiftUI: A modern toolkit for building native iOS UI.


Core Data: Used for Database Storage for iOS

## Architecture
This application follows the principles of MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) and Clean Architecture.

MVVM: The UI (RegistrationScreen.kt) is the View, which observes a ViewModel (not explicitly shown in the provided files but implied in a real-world app) for state changes. The ViewModel exposes data from the Model layer, which includes the data classes and the network service. This separation of concerns makes the UI more robust and easier to test.

Clean Architecture: The project is organized into distinct layers to separate the UI from the business logic and data.

Presentation Layer: Contains the UI components (RegistrationScreen.kt).

Data Layer: Handles data retrieval from network sources (network/).
